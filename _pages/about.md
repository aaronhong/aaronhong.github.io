I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at [The Comprehensive Income Dataset Project](https://cid.harris.uchicago.edu/) working with Professor Bruce Meyer.

I am a recent graduate of the University of California, San Diego with degrees in [Mathematics-Economics](https://www.math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/ma33-joint-major-in-math-econ/) and [Political Science](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/undergrad/major-and-minor-requirements/general.html).

During college, I worked as an RA at the School of Global Policy and Strategy under Professor Brian Libgober.
