I am an incoming PhD student at the Harris School of Public Policy at UChicago. I am interested in labor and public economics, with a particular emphasis on programs in the United States.

I previously worked as a Pre-Doctoral Fellow at [The Comprehensive Income Dataset Project](https://cid.harris.uchicago.edu/) with Professor Bruce Meyer and an RA at the School of Global Policy and Strategy under Professor Brian Libgober.

I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with degrees in [Mathematics-Economics](https://www.math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/ma33-joint-major-in-math-econ/) and [Political Science](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/undergrad/major-and-minor-requirements/general.html).
